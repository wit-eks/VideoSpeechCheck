TODO:

CHECK if all works as before :D


DONE Whole implementation of _mediaTranscriptor should be in Infrastructure
     with relation to 3rd party packages

DONE TranscriptionProcessor/Checker should be implemented in Core
	 
DONE TranscriptionSaver should be implemented in Core or in Infrastructure


DONE Perhaps IMessageWriter implementation should be moved to Cmd ??
     then any UI will relate to Core and implement its own message writer
	 the WPF will direct messages to some text box etc
	 the Cmd will direct messages to Console
	 So the implementation of IMessageWriter is UI specific


DONE, CHECK init missing arguments in config services
	- check embedded config file

DONE, Move 3rd packages dependency from Core

DONE, add logging
DONE, what if ggml type is not parsable
DONE, add description in config for Language and GgmlType
DONE, the code produces 2 transcribed files: *.speech and *prepared.small.txt, should be *.speech-small.txt
DONE, for EN we should be able to catch apostrophe:  That's what she's saying
DONE, unit test
		+ existence of good, 
			+ and partial
		+ not existence of good
		+ existence of bad, 
			+ and partial
		+ not existence of bad
DONE, UI test
		+ only good
		+ only bad, good empty + additional space between 
		+ existence of good, 
			+ and partial
		+ not existence of good
		+ existence of bad, 
			+ and partial
		+ not existence of bad

DONE, add logs, try/catches etc
DONE, dropping file from different folder should use paths where exe file exists
DONE, a special folder for files processed work
DONE, force audio and force transcribe


IN PROGRESS 
	- looks like the exe file needs runtimes with whishper dll folder :?





New UI as WPF with fancy stiling :D
